            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Ice cream is a sweet, frozen dessert made from dairy products, typically milk and cream, along with sweeteners like sugar.
             It is often flavored with fruits, chocolate, vanilla, and a wide variety of other ingredients. The mixture is churned while freezing 
             to prevent ice crystals from forming, creating its smooth, creamy texture.<br>
